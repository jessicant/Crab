CRAB - Focused Web Crawler

***ABOUT***
CRAB is a focused web crawler, in which currently
takes a CSV of "candidate" files and searches for
occurences of the word indicators defined in links
of the URL seed pages. deemed relevant pages 
are textually analysed in Weka for patterns which 
can then be used further i.e. Trading signals.

The candidate files we use are an array of Crypto
news sites, in the demo we are crawling through the 
seed set to find relevant links with our indicator 
words in this then may generate 
a signal i.e "BTC down 0.2%" in real time.

To run CRAB will require the following libraries:
OpenCSV: http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/
jsoup: https://jsoup.org/
Weka: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

***CURRENT STATUS***
CRAB is currently a work in progress mainly seen 
as a programming/learning exercise of developing a focused
web crawler.
